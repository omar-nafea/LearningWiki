            <p>This page is designed to be easily memorizable and understandable. I use 4 topics to easily form 4 chunks. Each topic has subtopics in it, and you can hide the definition of each topic so you can test yourself.</p>

        <h2><span class="plus" onclick="toggleParagraph(this)">-</span>Focus and Diffuse modes</h2>
        <article >
            <p>Focus mode is when you try to do a mental exercise. Like solving a math equation, trying to remember something very hard, or trying to understand a new concept, the importance of this mode is to make your mind do all these things; it can't do it without focusing.
                <br>
            Diffuse mode, on the other hand, is not to make any mental activity. The effort to do it is just fighting boredom, but the important thing is to complete the learning process because the brain does the work for you. First, it links the new information you just gained with your overall knowledge and related topics in your mind. Second, it gives your brain a break to be able to focus again.

        <h2><span class="plus" onclick="toggleParagraph(this)">-</span>Chunking</h2>
        <article >
            <p>Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning or use, and you can combine them together to see the big picture or be able to do a complex activity. They can also be applied to action, like any new skill anyone learns. He begins by learning the very basic moves, practicing them, then adding more moves until he has a number of chunks that can be combined together and make that skill.
                <q style="color: black;">A Chunk:A network of neurons that used to firing together so you can think of though or perform an action smoothly and effectivly</q> 
                The path to expertise is built little by little, so you chunk the concept you are trying to study or the skill you want to master, and the steps help you create chunks.<br>
            - Focus<br>
            - Understand<br> 
            - Practice makes you gain context on when to use this chunk(big picture)<br>

        <article >
            <p>Active recall has been proven to be the most effective way to study.
                and it has multiple forms. One of them is to look at a question or the title of a topic and try to retrieve what you know about it and what you understand. I like this form because it combines the power of revisit and the practice of testing yourself.

        <article >
            <p>Learning, as neorosciece has discovered until now, is a connection of neorons or the formation of synapses. Let's assume it's wires in your brain. Whenever you know, learn, or discover something new to you, a new synapse is formed, and even when this new information is connected with your current synapses, it creates new ones. Let's call it an internal road, and every time you repeat this information, the connection gets stronger.</p>

            <p>It's a phenomenon that makes you think you understand and are able to make something up, but you can't. It comes from knowing the solution if you read it. You tell yourself, Ah, I know that, but you can't solve the problem yourself because you know it but don't know How it can be executed, Not to mention, practice it.</p>

        <article >
            <p>Without sleeping well, all these beautiful tips about learning can't be applied because sleep is the stage that combines the benefits of diffuse mode, which is connecting new information with old ones and ejecting toxic material that has been formed in your brain over waking time.
